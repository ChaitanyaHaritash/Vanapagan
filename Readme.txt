Newer version of Rehepapp (for Windows only but will add more stuff during the year 2020)

Modules needed:
WinAppDbg (https://github.com/MarioVilas/winappdbg/)
pywin32 (https://pypi.org/project/pywin32/)
psutil (https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)

Running:
python fuzz.py {conf file}

Conf file example should be quite readable but I will soon follow with blog post where I give more info about the tool and fuzzing overall.
